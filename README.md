A loan management system, or LMS for short, is a piece of software used by lenders to manage and track loans. Simply put, it automates the loan management process, including tasks such as loan origination, underwriting, servicing, and collection. In the past, traditional lending systems were used to manage these processes manually, which was not only time-consuming but required managers to manually collect and verify data, making mistakes a probability.

Although loan management systems have come a long way since their introduction, as the market is growing, companies are seeking to take advantage of the latest technology and upgrade their systems with the most recent loan management software features to get an edge over their competitors.
